CMD:
main.go

PKG:
config = app.go (connect to DB)
controllers = book-controller (Handles HTTP requests and sends responses back to presentation layer)
models = book.go (structs and models that will be used by our DB)
routes = bookstore-routes (routes of different functions "/book" "/book/{id}")
utils = utils.go (code for marshalling and unmarshalling json from our response and request)

Routes:
HTTP REQUEST -> Route -> Controller Function
GET -> /book -> getBooks
GET -> /book/{id} -> getBook
POST -> /book -> createBook
etc.

User interacts with the routes
The routes send control to the controllers
Controllers perform some operations with the DB
The operations to interact with the DB live inside the models file
Config sets up the DB (which the models call upon)


In main we set up the server and where our routers reside
